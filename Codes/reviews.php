Still i am 
But this is something different as dominos have limited choices of toppings, 
Hut swag is spicy, affordable, very fresh and quick in delivery with mouth watering cheese

Love their pizzas especially the Cheese Pizza and Paneer Tikka  Pizza !! However the place is very crowded on Wednesday and Friday because of the Bogo Offer and so I prefer take-away !

Visited this place two weeks back along with my friends on Saturday . The place was fully packed . they got nice ambience and sitting arrangement.

Everything is better , from the taste to appearance and also delivery .

The was average and yet justified by their quality and quantity .service was quick and also helpful staff ..

Well the pizza base was below average, topics are just for the sake of putting something on. They always overload the toppings with one which is cheap, seasonal and readily availble in the market.
No proportion for balancing out each topping in comparison to other.

A good Pizza place in town if you're hungry and you've a big group of friends. Serves giant pizzas and they literally mean it. :P I do recommend improving the quality of bread they use as base. But food is overall good and enough for any number of people (provided you chose wisely)
